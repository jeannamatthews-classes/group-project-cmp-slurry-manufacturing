# Tutorial Thing

## docs
Within the docs directory their are 2 sub directories named planning and timelog.

### planning
This will be used to track everytime the Gantt Chart is updated.

### timelog
This will be used by each member to document what they have done. The format is:
Date:
Time:
Description:

* Time (in minutes) how long you spent working on that tasks

## TODOS
[] Every member need to make a sub-directory under **timelog** named after their Clarkson username.

[] Make a .txt file with this format: **year,month,day**, within the sub-directory that you made above.

[] She said to track down everything you did from March 11th and onwards. So probably add something like working on the UML diagram.
