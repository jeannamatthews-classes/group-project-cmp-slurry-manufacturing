        <h2>Welcome to CMP Slurry!</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Clarkson University has a long-standing reputation for excellence in engineering and sustainability.
                Over the past 25 years, we have been at the forefront of Chemical Mechanical Planary research, organizing
                the annual CAMP CMP conference that brings together experts from around the world. Our faculty, including
                has actively collaborated with global industry leader to advance CMP process in Semiconductor industries.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given the rapid growth of the Semiconductor industry, especially with companies like Micron establishing
                operations in New York, there is an urgent need to focus on sustainability within manufacturing processes.
                Our team has been working diligently to develop a sustainable framework for CMP slurry manufacturing, which
                is crucial for the production of semiconductor devices.
            </p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
                We have created a comprehensive Excel workbook titled
                <strong>"Robust impact Analysis (Focused on EHSS) of CMP Slurry Manufactoring".</strong>
                This tool will be used to evaulate the environment impact, energy consumption, and efficiency of various
                processes involved in producing cerium oxide slurry, a key consumable component in CMP processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our goal is to transform this Excel-based analysis into an interactive and user-friendly web application.
                This will allow users to easily input data, analyze results, and gain insights into the sustainability of CMP slurry.
                By leveraging the power of web technologies, we aim to make this tool accessible to a wider audience,
                enabling researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to make informed decisions regarding CMP slurry manufacturing.
