Deployment docs - How to go from what is in github to working version of the system.

To get what we have from Github to a working version of the system there are three parts which will be needed.

1) We still need to finish up some of the tabs which includes the data from the Excel.

2) We need to work on the JavaScript part of it too. That way it system would be able to calculate values from the user and use that information to compare against other processes. Then using that, the user will be able to see which process is better for the environment and cost-effective.

3) Have a domain that way the website will be able to be viewed by the public. This could be done easily and it is easy to maintain. It will be about ~$20 per year (maybe less) to maintain it.
