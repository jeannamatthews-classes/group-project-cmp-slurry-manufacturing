How users of various kinds can use the system.


The full system isn't completed yet, but if it was the user would be able to use the data collected by Clarkson faculty member to get valuable information on processes. This includes process time, energy consumption, waste, quality of product, yield, and emission level. This would also later include something about the "impact assessment", which calculated all the things above and see which process is good.

This leads us the the second part of what the system should be able to do. After the user input, they will be able to compare it to other processes with that was completed.

Additionally, the user can also include data's of their own to the website.

This will all be possible when the full system is completed.
