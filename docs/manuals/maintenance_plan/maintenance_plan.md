Is anyone on the team planning to continue work on the system in any capacity (directed study? just on your own?)?
Ask your user how they might handle if they see bugs in the system or find some functionality they would like to have added.
Do they have any resources they might use to maintain the software going forward?

Billy Wilkinson: We have not shown our users a demo in addition to the one on the 22nd but our users did seem to enjoy and appreciate the work done.
                 I really enjoyed working with the users and learning about the topic, given the time and opportunity I would like to continue the project
                 A member of the group does have some experience with Web development and i'm confident could figure out and expand the funcitonality of what we've given the user.
                 Members of the group are available to contact for questions though.
                 I believe the user already has plans for improvements

Jason Weng: I'm not likely to continue working on the system, but if I have time I will try to built a working website on my own.
                Working on this project was very enjoyable and it taught me a variety of skills for Web Development. Some of the things in the system, I still need to know how it works and how to utilize it.
