After meeting with the user and discussing among team members, we got the rough layout as to how the website would look like. After completing the assigment for the UML diagram, we were able to use that idea to structure the frontend part of the website. This allowed out team to start the implementation process.

The Gantt Chart is the same as the the one from 20250303. The only difference is that we started the implmentation process. This is important for our team as it allowed us to start somewhere. Later on, we plan to included .js aspects into the website, which will mean using the data from the Excel sheet.
