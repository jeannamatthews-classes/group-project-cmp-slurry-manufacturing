After the another group meeting on March 27th, we decided to update the Gantt chart which we had. We noticed that the previous Gantt Chart had many tasks that overlaps.

## Update V2 of Gantt Chart

From this Gantt chart, we can see that all the "implementation sheet ##" is gone. This is because we realized that we don't have to implement every single tab from thh Excel sheet. Some of the tabs are just an extension to another. For instance, the "input" tab is the layout for the "process" tab. Hence, we only need to implement the "input" tab from the Excel and use javasrcipt to process that information.

This allowed us the simply our Gantt chart and make the tasks more understandable to execute later on.
