Description:
I made the layout needed for the assignement "Additions to Github repos and Time Tracking Materials. These included:

1. Making the doc directory
2. Making the sub-directory --> planning and timelog
3. Made sub-directory for planning and added what we did for "20250303"
4. Made sub-directories within timelog. I have added my sub-directory and will tell the rest of the members to add theirs.

P.S. For the sub-directory "20250303", it would include, 5 files in total. Below desribes what each one is:

1. 20250303_displayed.md --> A viewable thing on Github which gives the overview of what we did during that day
2. Initial_Gantt.png --> A screenshot of the Gantt chart which is used in 20250303_displayed.md
3. Initial_Brainstorming.png --> A screenshot of our groups brainstorming
4. CMP GANTT Chart --> A .pdf version of the Gantt chart
5. GANTT Chart Tasks --> A .pdf version of answering the 7 questions. (Not the same copy as the we handed it, but it was on the Google Sheet and we discussed about it)
