Date: 4/5/25

Time (minutes): ~150 minutes

Description:

I began working on some of the tabs and finished it. During this process, I also worked on the layout of the website, this included the coloring, table format, header format and etc...

1. 4/2/25 (~90 minutes)

* I worked on the required info tab.
* While I did this, I formatted the table a bit, that way it looks neater.

2. 4/5/25 (~60 minutes)

* I worked on creating the home tab.
* I made some adjustments to all other tabs in where if there are tables that are too long, it will become scrollable. Cause in the input tab, the table containers are larger then expected, hence I added scrollers, that way when the screen it smaller, it would still function correctly.
* I am currently still working on the help tab.
